## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Being a small project, the main thing I learned was connecting to an api and using promises to pass data to a function.

### Continued development

In my upcoming projects, I want a better grasp on how to manage the data from an api better as well as what json really is and does.

### Useful resources

- [WebDevSimplified on Fetch API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHvZLI7Db8E&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) and  [JavaScript Promises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuEtnrL9-H0&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) - These two videos gave me a starting point to understand how to use the fetch to grab data from an api.
